## RME Babyface pro input gain support

Attempt to patch the kernel to add support for gain on my RME Babyface Pro card. 
The groundwork mostly done by Thomas Ebeling(i believe?) and this is ment to just add the missing functionality of setting input gain. 
Inspiration is also taken from Adrien Gesta-Fline who did a lot of reverse engineering of the USB protocol, even though that was geared towards RME Fireface UC.

Not really sure i know what i'm doing, so this is just an experiment with the help of Master Andy and chatgpt
